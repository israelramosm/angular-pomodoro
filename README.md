* As a user, I can mark as done a task
* As a user, I can delete a task either completed or not
* As a user, I can edit a task that is not marked as done, either the name or number of intervals
* As a user, I can pause, stop or resume the timer once itâ€™s running
* As a user, I want to see the raining time in the mm:ss format
